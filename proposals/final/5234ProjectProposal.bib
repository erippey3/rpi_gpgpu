	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution and the underlying digital transformation, known as Industry 4.0, is progressing exponentially. The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.},

The study used the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. We developed six benchmark programs using three libraries that included: GPUFFT, Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) and Python SciPy FFTpack (SciPy FFT) [1-3]. They were used for doing FFT in both one dimension (1D) and two dimensions (2D) using single precision floating point numbers. We measured the error values, run-time, power and energy consumed by the calculation. We found that GPGPU code was more energy efficient and faster than the serial code on both RPI models. We interpreted that for a typical complex value calculation, the GPU not only produced comparable results in significantly less time, but it did so with less total energy expenditure.},

The implemented correlation algorithm is based on Fourier transform with the frequency sweep. In the paper, we analyzed the task of real-time acquisition and processing of acoustic signals with the Raspberry Pi computers. Then we modified the algorithm of computation of time frequency-correlation function to be applicable in real-time and implemented it as a C++ object. To increase the performance, we implemented GPU acceleration using GPU\_FFT and Vulkan FFT libraries. The first library is a firmware that utilizes VideoCore IV on Raspberry Pi 3B+. Vulkan FFT library was implemented as an alternative compatible with VideoCore VI on Raspberry 4B. To estimate the efficiency of applying the graphical cores to we conducted a set of experiments. Those experiments were designed to measure the reduction in processing time after accelerating the most time computationally operation of inverse Fourier transform with the GPU. According to the results, we have concluded that GPU acceleration is efficient and makes possible the real-time processing of acoustic signals even of Raspberry Pi 3B+. The GPU acceleration proved to be the most crucial when large Fourier transform window size and the significant number of frequency bands are used.},

However, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results in two issues: (1) protracted turnaround time from sample collection to testing result and (2) compromised test accuracy, as low as 67\%, due to when and how the samples are collected, packaged, and delivered to the lab to conduct the RT-PCR test. Thus, we present ComputeCOVID19+, our computed tomography-based framework to improve the testing speed and accuracy of COVID-19 (plus its variants) via a deep learning-based network for CT image enhancement called DDnet, short for DenseNet and Deconvolution network. To demonstrate its speed and accuracy, we evaluate ComputeCOVID19+ across several sources of computed tomography (CT) images and on many heterogeneous platforms, including multicore CPU, many-core GPU, and even FPGA. Our results show that ComputeCOVID19+ can significantly shorten the turnaround time from days to minutes and improve the testing accuracy to 91\%.},

However, with the growing ubiquity of parallel computing devices, we argue that it is unclear how best to express parallel computation, and hence, a need exists to identify a higher level of abstraction for reasoning about parallel application requirements. Therefore, the goal of this combination “Work-in-Progress and Vision” paper is to delineate application requirements in a manner that is not overly speciﬁc to individual applications or the optimizations used for certain hardware platforms, so that we can draw broader conclusions about hardware requirements. Our initial eﬀort, dubbed “OpenCL and the 13 Dwarfs” or OCD for short, realizes Berkeley’s 13 computational dwarfs of scientiﬁc computing in OpenCL, where each dwarf captures a pattern of computation and communication that is common to a class of important applications.},

	abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism. We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following: • The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems • The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar. • Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 “Dwarfs” to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.) • “Autotuners” should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs. • To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. • To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors. • To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism. 1 The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View From Berkeley • Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters. • Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines. • To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost. Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems.},
